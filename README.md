JavaScript Operators Demo

This project demonstrates practical use cases of JavaScript operators, focused on:

Arithmetic Operators – Performing calculations, such as totaling costs for art painting materials.

Assignment Operators – Managing stock shares and calculating total stock value.

Comparison Operators – Simulating consumer choices in microeconomics by comparing utility and price of goods.

Logical Operators – Using conditional statements to model real-life situations with multiple conditions.
